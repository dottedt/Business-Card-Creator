== A quick, unfinished proof of concept

I found out that the Code Academy/Starter League staff were hand manipulating the information for the business cards
they were handing out to the students and thought it could be automated.

I did a little research, found Prawn and this is the result.

It's very limited due to Prawn's view on how text is manipulated and structured.  Also it's very narrow in it's use case.
